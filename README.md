This is what I have learnt in python and how I have learnt in python..
Well I will be learning python and focusing on pygame and arcade libraries later on for game development.
I have also uploaded notes of python that I have made using gemini AI and I will be updating it time by time.
Here I will be following campus python tutorials on python. You all should watch it too as it is great and can help you all in understanding python easily.
